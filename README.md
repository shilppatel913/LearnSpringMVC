**What is Spring MVC(Model-View-Controller)**

1) A  Spring MVC is a sub framework of the Spring Framework which is used to build web applications.
2) It is build on the top of Servlet API,
3) It follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern which was not present in Servlets.

Model means creating and working with database models.
View means creating HTML pages.
Controller means who will have the control of the particular request and how things will be carried out in the backend.

**Why SpringMVC**
1) In Spring MVC we are seperately working on building models , views and controllers meaning all three of them are loosely coupled.
2) Powerful configuration.
3) MVC is quite flexible and supports rapid application development.
